# Advent of Code 2022

This repository contains my solution for the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

## How to run
You can run the programs for the different days from this directory using
```bash
cargo run -p dayxx # replace xx with the actual number
```

## How to test
As usual, tests are run with
```bash
cargo test 
```
Again, you can test only a specific day with the `-p` argument.
